Overview

Overview

This project is a culmination of my journey in mastering various aspects of software development. Through this repository, I aim to share the knowledge and experiences gained in understanding object-oriented design, game programming, and project structuring. The content provided here serves as a comprehensive resource for fellow learners and developers looking to deepen their skills.
Compilation Highlights
Object-Oriented Design

    Encapsulation (Data and Implementation Hiding): Delved into the art of encapsulating data and concealing implementation details for creating resilient and modular code.

    Polymorphism (Covariance and Contravariance): Explored the nuanced concepts of covariance and contravariance in polymorphism, unlocking the potential for flexible and extensible code.

    Aggregation versus Inheritance: Learned the subtleties between aggregation and inheritance, gaining insights into when to employ each in designing object-oriented systems.

Game Programming

    Design Patterns: Implemented crucial design patterns in game programming, including Singleton, Flyweight, Factory, Strategy, State, and Command patterns.

Project Planning and Structure

    Large Scale Project Planning: Developed proficiency in planning and structuring large-scale projects, including the art of specifying and designing components.

    Version Control: Mastered the use of version control systems for iterative development, facilitating collaboration and efficient tracking of changes.

    Integration of Components: Learned strategies for seamlessly integrating multiple library and system components within a project.

    Documentation: Harnessed the power of documentation tools to ensure clarity and maintainability in your codebase.

Development Environment Mastery

    Building Projects from Scratch: Acquired skills to initiate and build projects from the ground up, fostering self-sufficiency in development.

    Debugging Strategies: Explored effective debugging strategies, including utilizing the call stack, basic tracing, watchpoints, and conditional breakpoints.

Final Thoughts
This project was an excellent breakthrough into the game programming and software development world for me, and after completing my work, I realized that the work is never actually quite done. That is to say, the more you learn as a programmer the more you see how much there is still yet to learn, and that is very exciting to know. Looking forward to my next game development project!
